<p>Cada día que pasa el <em>single</em> de <a href="http://www.kemmusic.com" title="Kem">Kem</a> me parece mejor, "I Can't Stop Loving You" es un temazo, de lo mejor de este año. Personalmente, pienso que este principio de año está siendo genial, hacía tiempo que no teníamos tan buenos artistas haciendo tan buena música.</p>
<p>Aquí tenéis la letra de "I Can't Stop Loving You" de Kem:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>I think about the day I met the perfect stranger</p></blockquote>
<p>I think about us</p>
<p>And I think about the day I got wrapped around your finger</p>
<p>I think about us</p>
<p>The sun was shining on you</p>
<p>The Lord was smiling on me</p>
<p>And love was calling us</p>
<p>I had my mind made up</p>
<p>I cant stop loving you</p>
<p>I can't help myself</p>
<p>And I can't get over you</p>
<p>No matter what I tell myself baby</p>
<p>Never thought Id love anyone else</p>
<p>In my weakness</p>
<p>I think about us</p>
<p>And I think about the day you left without speaking</p>
<p>I think about us</p>
<p>I think about the love we had for our children</p>
<p>I think about us</p>
<p>I think about the way we laughed without a reason</p>
<p>I think about us girl</p>
<p>There will be no more lies</p>
<p>Somebody tell me why I feel like Im dieing</p>
<p>Lord whats come over me?</p>
<p>Ooh baby can't you see that.</p>
<p>I cant stop loving you</p>
<p>I can't help myself</p>
<p>And I can't get over you (I cant get over you baby)</p>
<p>No matter what I tell myself baby (No matter what I tell myself baby)</p>
<p>I cant stop loving you girl (I cant stop loving you girl)</p>
<p>No matter how hard I try (No matter how hard I try)</p>
<p>And I can't get over you (I cant get over you baby)</p>
<p>And I dont know why</p>
<p>I think about us (repeat 7x)</p>
<p>I can't get over you baby</p>
<p>Girl</p>
