<p>Realmente podría llenar una lista bien larga con mis temas favoritos de <strong>Stevie Wonder</strong>, supongo que a muchos de vosotros os pasará lo mismo.</p>
<p>Acabo de ver el vídeo de <strong>Overjoyed</strong> del álbum <a href="http://www.cduniverse.com/search/xx/music/pid/1050652/a/In+Square+Circle.htm" title="Stevie Wonder: In Square Circle"><strong>In Square Circle</strong></a> de 1985, que ya no recordaba.  Para mí, <strong>Overjoyed</strong> es uno de los grandes temas de amor de <strong>Stevie Wonder</strong>. La letra es genial, ¿hay algún artista que haya escrito mejores letras que <strong>Stevie Wonder</strong>? Y el sonido, cómo la canta y la siente, totalmente inolvidable:</p>

<p><em>Over time, I've building my castle of love<br />
Just for two, though you never knew you were my reason<br />
I've gone much too far for you now to say<br />
That I've got to throw my castle away</p>
<p>Over dreams, I have picked out a perfect come true<br />
Though you never knew it was of you I've been dreaming<br />
The sandman has come from too far away<br />
For you to say come back some other day</p>
<p>And though you don't believe that they do<br />
They do come true<br />
For did my dreams<br />
Come true when I looked at you<br />
And maybe too, if you would believe<br />
You too might be<br />
Overjoyed, over loved, over me</p>
<p>Over hearts, I have painfully turned every stone<br />
Just to find, I had found what I've searched to discover<br />
I've come much too far for me now to find<br />
The love that I've sought can never be mine</p>
<p>And though you don't believe that they do<br />
They do come true<br />
For did my dreams<br />
Come true when I looked at you<br />
And maybe too, if you would believe<br />
You too might be<br />
Overjoyed, over loved, over me</p>
<p>And though the odds say improbable<br />
What do they know<br />
For in romance<br />
All true love needs is a chance<br />
And maybe with a chance you will find<br />
You too like I<br />
Overjoyed, over loved, over you, over you</em></p>
