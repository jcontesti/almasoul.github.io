<p>I saw you walking</p>
<p>Down on Melrose</p>
<p><strong>You looked like an angel</strong></p>
<p>Straight out of heaven, girl</p>
<p>I was blown away by</p>
<p>Your sexiness</p>
<p>All I have to do is catch up to you</p>
<p>[Hook:]</p>
<p>Slow down I just wanna get to know you</p>
<p>But don't turn around</p>
<p>Cuz that pretty round thing looks good to me</p>
<p>Slow down never seen anything so lovely</p>
<p>Now turn around</p>
<p>And <strong>bless me with your beauty</strong>, cutie</p>
<p>A butterfly tattoo</p>
<p>Right above your naval</p>
<p>Your belly button's pierced too just like I like it girl</p>
<p>Come take a walk with me</p>
<p>You'll be impressed by</p>
<p>The game that I kick to you</p>
<p>It's over and for reeaal</p>
<p>[Bridge:]</p>
<p><strong>Like a flower fully bloomed in the summertime</strong>, you're ready</p>
<p>To be watered by this conversation, you're ready</p>
<p>And we all can use shine like the sun</p>
<p>Let me be the one to enjoy you</p>
<p>Let's kick it girl</p>
<p>[Hook x2]</p>
<p>Oh baby you know by now that I want you bad</p>
<p>I'm floating on open air I can't come down</p>
<p>Cupid hit me already damn</p>
<p>Now I can't leave till seven digits are in my hand, my hand</p>
<p>[Bridge]</p>
<p>[Hook x2]</p>
<p>Slow down never seen anything so lovely</p>
<p>Cutie</p>
<p>[Hook]</p>
