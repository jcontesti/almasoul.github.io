<p>Me encanta la letra del clásico de <a href="http://www.soulwalking.co.uk/Roberta%20Flack.html" title="Roberta Flack en SoulWalking">Roberta Flack</a>.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">The first time ever I saw your face<br />
<br />I thought the sun rose in your eyes<br />
<br />And the moon and stars were the gifts you gave<br />
<br />To the dark and the empty skies, my love,<br />
<br />To the dark and the empty skies.</p>
<p>The first time ever I kissed your mouth<br />
<br />And felt your heart beat close to mine<br />
<br />Like the trembling heart of a captive bird<br />
<br />That was there at my command, my love<br />
<br />That was there at my command.</p>
<p>The first time ever I lay with you<br />
<br />I felt the earth move in my hand<br />
<br />I thought our joy would fill the earth<br />
<br />And last 'til the end of time, my love,<br />
<br />And last 'til the end of time.</span></p>
