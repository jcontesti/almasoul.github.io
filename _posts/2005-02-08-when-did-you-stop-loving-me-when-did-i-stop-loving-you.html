<p>Cuando dejaste de amarme, cuando dejé de amarte... Durante muchos años, el conocido Berry Gordy de Motown, el padre de Anna Gordy, le prestó dinero a Marvin. Esto, unido a que Berry estaba furioso porque Marvin quería dejar Motown y Anna odiaba a Marvin por haberle pedido el divorcio, hizo que Anna le pidiera $1,000,000 a Marvin por el divorcio, pero Marvin consiguió acordar pagar $600,000. La mitad por adelantado y la otra mitad por lo que ganaría con un disco. Así, Berry tenía su disco para Motown y el dinero que quería Anna. Por este motivo en el año 1978 publica Here, My Dear. Es un disco muy personal y quizá sea el menos apreciado de los discos de Marvin Gaye, donde escribe sobre su matrimonio con Anna, desde el inicio hasta el final. Es un disco espléndido, profundo y uno de los más humanos que se pueden escuchar. Una auténtica obra de arte. La canción "When Did You Stop Loving Me, When Did I Stop Loving You" consigue emocionarme cada vez que la escucho... </p>

<br />You know, when you say your marriage vows, they're supposed to be for real. I mean...<br />
<br />if you think back about what you really said, you know, about, honor and loving and<br />
<br />obeying till death do us part and all. But it shouldn't be that way, it should...it<br />
<br />should, it shouldn't be lies because it turns out to be lies. If you don't honor what<br />
<br />you said, you lie to God. The words should be changed.</p>
<p>Ooo now as I recall, we tried a million times<br />
<br />Again and again and again, and that isn't all<br />
<br />I gave my love to you each time to make amends<br />
<br />Suddenly I start to realize I can't make it<br />
<br />Pretty birds fly away, I had to leave you for my health's sake<br />
<br />What to do? Make you pay, for leaving you, my fine, is to pay forever<br />
<br />So if a fresh new love comes in, I won't say those words again<br />
<br />Instead I'll say I'll try to love and protect you<br />
<br />With all my heart as long as you want me to baby</p>
<p>Ooo if I love again I'm gonna try a new way this time<br />
<br />Memories of the things we did; some we're proud of, some we hid<br />
<br />So when two people have to part, sometimes it makes them stronger<br />
<br />Do you remember all of the bullshit, baby?<br />
<br />You say you love me with all your heart<br />
<br />If you ever loved me will all of your heart<br />
<br />You'd never take a million dollars to part<br />
<br />I really tried, you know I tried, oh baby<br />
<br />Although we tried, all of those promises was nothin' but lies<br />
<br />I really tried, you know how I really tried, we really lied, didn't we baby?<br />
<br />And on top of that you have scandalized my name<br />
<br />What I can't understand is if you love me<br />
<br />How could you turn me into the police?<br />
<br />Didn't I love you good and try to take care of you?<br />
<br />Best that I could<br />
<br />You were so divine<br />
<br />And your love was like mellow wine<br />
<br />Pains of love, miles of tears,<br />
<br />Enough to last me for my lifetime<br />
<br />Broken hearts last for years, soon break away to the noonday sunshine<br />
<br />One thing I can promise, friend: I'll never be back again<br />
<br />But I'm not really bitter babe<br />
<br />I wish you all the luck and all the love in the world,<br />
<br />good love in the world (good luck in the world)<br />
<br />But I know you'll never be satisfied<br />
<br />No, you still want me standin' by your side</p>
<p>Memories haunt you all the time, I will never leave your mind<br />
<br />Got judgement on your side; you've said bad things and you've lied<br />
<br />Still I remember some of the good things baby<br />
<br />Like love after dark and picnics in parks<br />
<br />Those are the days I'll not forget in my life<br />
<br />I'd rather remember, remember the joy we shared babe<br />
<br />I'd rather remember all the fun we had<br />
<br />All I ever really wanted was to love you and treat you right<br />
<br />All we did was fuss and fight<br />
<br />It don't matter baby, take a lesson from them all<br />
<br />I never thought I'd see the day when you'd put me through what you put me through<br />
<br />You tried your best, you say I gave you no rest</p>
<p>When did you stop loving me? When did I stop loving you?<br />
<br />When did you stop loving me? When did I stop loving you?<br />
<br /></em></p>
